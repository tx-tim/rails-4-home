                Because some things can’t wait until payday®
                We understand that paychecks don’t always stretch. And things like car repairs, higher-than-expected electric bills, or extra groceries, can put a kink in your finances. That’s when a cash advance/short-term loan or payday advance can come in handy.

                Cash advance—also called a short-term loan, payday advance or a deferred deposit transaction—can help tide you over until your next payday. Depending upon the law of the state where you reside, you can request a cash advance of $100 to $1,500 and, upon approval, get cash in minutes1. Once your completed loan application is approved, all you have to do in most cases is write us a personal check or authorize us to debit your deposit account electronically (ACH) for the amount of the loan, plus fees2, and we hold your check or refrain from debiting your bank account electronically (ACH) until the loan is due—usually your next payday. The process is fast. It’s easy. And, it’s confidential.

                Cash America owns and operates about 180 stand-alone cash advance/payday advance locations throughout the United States under the brand names Cashland and Payday Advance. These stores offer a variety of services, including cash advances/short-term loans, check cashing, pre-paid debit cards, money orders, money transfers, tax filing services and the purchase of gold in select locations. In addition, many of our pawnshops offer payday advances, or you can apply for a cash advance/payday advance online through our subsidiary cashnetusa.com. Cash America is an active member of the Community Financial Services Association, the governing body for an association that promotes responsible lending, and we abide by its best practices.

                A single payday advance is typically for two to four weeks. However, borrowers often use these loans over a period of months, which can be expensive. Payday advances are not recommended as long-term financial solutions."

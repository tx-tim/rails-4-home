This appraisal process for a pawn item varies depending on the type of item—for example, jewelry is evaluated differently than a DVD player—but every appraisal is done with the intent of getting you the money you need.
                    What It's Worth

                    Our pawnshops are routinely audited by an Internal Audit & Security Department, and work closely with local law enforcement officials.

                                    Pawn loans are based on the value of your item—its current value and its current condition. We have an internal pricing department that researches thousands of items so we know what the item’s retail value was when it was new, what it sells for used, and how to determine its condition (good, better, best). At Cash America, you can feel confident that you are getting a fair price for your collateral.
